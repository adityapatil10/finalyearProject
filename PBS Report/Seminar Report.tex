\end{center}


Traffic is turning out to be one of the most increasing and serious problem for people worldwide and specially for countries like India .Due to increase in use of vehicles, the problem of congestion on roads is becoming a serious issue in cities .Four Indian cities including Bengaluru (1st rank )  , Mumbai (4th rank), Pune (5th rank ) ,  Delhi (8th rank) in 2019 among the top 10 most congested cities of the world. Bengaluru residents lose 243 hours on average (10 days and 3 hour) every year due to traffic.\par
This problem is not only limited to unwanted congestion in journey or triggering of stress in drivers but can be a serious threat to the environment too.About 27\% of air is polluted by vehicles.According to a report from European Environment Agency(EEA), outdoor air pollution could cause 6 to 9 million premature deaths a year by 2060. While there are a number of factors linked to this, a major contributor of pollutionis traffic, caused by the ever-increasing number of vehicles on the roads.
. With the use of Density Based Traffic control system the effect of traffic on air can be reduced significantly.\par

\subsection{ Introduction to Project}
\begin{center}
	\textbf{\Large{Project Title  : Density based Traffic management system }}
\end{center}
	To minimize the traffic delays on the traffic signal.Traffic is turning out to be one of the most increasing and serious problem for people worldwide and specially for countries like India .Due to increase in use of vehicles, the problem of congestion on roads is becoming a serious issue in cities.\par
This increase in traffic leads to many problems such as increase in wait time.Due to ever increasing nature of traffic a density-based traffic control system is necessary that aids the swift movement of vehicles .This problem is not only limited to unwanted congestion in journey or triggering of stress in drivers but also serious threat to the environment. In this project we try to come up with a promising solution for the control of traffic.\par




\subsection{ Motivation behind project topic}

Due to increase in use of vehicles, the problem of congestion on roads is becoming a serious issue in cities .
Four Indian cities including Bengaluru (1st rank )  , Mumbai (4th rank), Pune (5th rank ) ,  Delhi (8th rank) in 2019 among the top 10 most congested cities of the world.
Bengaluru residents lose 243 hours on average (10 days and 3 hour) every year due to traffic. To put it in perspective an average Bengaluru resident could have watched 215 episodes of Game of Thrones or have done some productive work with the time spent while waiting on traffic signals .
About 27\% of air is polluted by vehicles.According to a report from European Environment Agency(EEA), outdoor air pollution could cause 6 to 9 million premature deaths a year by 2060. While there are a number of factors linked to this, a major contributor of pollutionis traffic, caused by the ever-increasing number of vehicles on the roads. 

\subsection{ Aim and Objective(s) of the work}

\textbf{Project aim:}
	 To minimize the time delays on the traffic signal and manage traffic effectively.
\ldots "
\\

\textbf{Project objectives:} 
	To increase the efficiency of traffic signals we intend to use 
	"Signal phase extension " and "Time adjustment theory".
\\
To compare the traditional traffic system with the Density Based Traffic system. 


\subsection{ Introduction to Seminar Topic}
This project  focuses to improve the efficiency of current traffic lights which will eventually redulce the waiting time of vehicle on traffic lights and eventually reduce the Environmental harms.We have achieved this using density based traffic control system which calculates the green signal time using the number of vehicles on that particular lane.

\section {\textbf{\large Density based traffic system}}
\subsection{ Introduction to Green signal timers}

We propose to calculate green signal timer by calculating the density of different class of vehicles on a particular lane of traffic signal junction ,this would have a rela time analysis and hence could help in smartly managing the traffic .

\subsection{Equations }
\begin{center}
\begin{math}
\bf\sum_n \frac{\huge t_n * \huge v}{\huge l}
\end{math}
\end{center}
where,\par
GST - Green signal timer\par
 n - class of vehicle \par 
t - average time for a class of vehicle to pass the junction\par
 v - count of vehicles of a patricular class\par
 c - capacity of sublane to hold vehicle of a particular class\par
 l - no of sublanes in a lane\par

\newpage
\subsection{Cases of Green Signal Time }
There can be three casses in Green Signal Time :\\ \par 

\textbf{case 1} - Calculated G.S.T. is less than minimum value . In that case the value of GST for that lane would be set to minimum value.\\ \par

\textbf{case 2 }-  Calculated G.S.T. is more than maximum value . In that case the value of GST for that lane would be set to maximum value.\\\ \par

\textbf{case 3} - Calculated G.S.T. is between maximum and minimum value . In that case the value of GST for that lane would be set to calculated value.\\ \par



\newpage
\section {\textbf{\large Vehicle classification}}


\subsection{ Types of vehicles}
\begin{tabular}{||l|c|r|p{6cm}||}
    Sr.No. & Class & Vehicle  \\
    1 & class 1 & Bus and Truck \\
    2 & class 2 &Tempo and Mini Bus \\
    3 & class 3 & 4-Wheeler cars \\
    4 & class 4 & Rikshaw and other 3-Wheelers \\
    5 & class 5 & Bikes and other 2-Wheelers \\
\end{tabular}
\subsection{Classification Method }
The video of lane is captured by the cameras instaled on every signal and number of vehicles are calculated through openCV and YOLO v5
(In our project we have selected a video from local computer which acts as the captured video).            
\newpage
       
\section {\textbf{\large YOLO v5 }}
\subsection{ Intorduction}
CNN-based Object Detectors are primarily applicable for recommendation systems. YOLO (You Only Look Once) models are used for Object detection with high performance. YOLO divides an image into a grid system, and each grid detects objects within itself. They can be used for real-time object detection based on the data streams. They require very few computational resources.

\subsection{Why IoT }
{\textbf Automation and Control}
Due to physical objects getting connected and controlled digitally and centrally with wireless infrastructure, there is a large amount of automation and control in the workings Without human intervention, the machines are able to communicate with each other leading to faster and timely output.\par
{\textbf Cost Efficientl}
The biggest advantage of IoT is saving money. If the price of the tagging and monitoring equipment is less than the amount of money saved, then the Internet of Things will be very widely adopted. IoT fundamentally proves to be very helpful to people in their daily routines by making the appliances communicate to each other in an effective manner thereby saving and conserving energy and cost. Allowing the data to be communicated and shared between devices and then translating it into our required way, it makes our systems efficient.\par
{\textbf Fast and Efficientl}
The machine-to-machine interaction provides better efficiency, hence; accurate results can be obtained fast. This results in saving valuable time. Instead of repeating the same tasks every day, it enables people to do other creative jobs.\par
{\textbf Information}
It is obvious that having more information helps making better decisions. Whether it is mundane decisions as needing to know what to buy at the grocery store or if your company has enough widgets and supplies, knowledge is power and more knowledge is better.
\newpage   
\section {\textbf{\large Implementation}}
\subsection{ IoT using Cloud}
IoT devices can generate lots of data, cloud computing paves the way for this data to travel\par
Cloud computing enables the storage and analysis of data to be done quickly and I n real-time\par
IoT cloud platform: IoT device has multiple sensors and it is connected to the cloud via gateways. Eg. AWS IoT, Microsoft Azure IoT Hub, Google Cloud IoT, IBM Watson IoT Platform\par
\newpage     
\subsection{ RFID Implementation}
RFID is used in this system to detect the emergency vehicles which are nearing the signal which has a RFID reader installed in it which connects to a microcontroller and communicates with the cloud to send signal when emergency vehicles come near to the signal.
\par

			\label{fig_23}
		\end{figure}
\newpage   
\subsection{Actual Implementation}
Step1: Scan the lane using OpenCV through cameras and classify the vehicles using YOLOv5.\par
Step2: Through the number of different types of vehicles in that lane calculate the Green Signal Time using the formula.\par
Step3: From the given casses decide time that must be allocated to that lane. \par
Step4: Assign the Green Signal Time for the particular signal\par
Step5: Scan the next lane\par
